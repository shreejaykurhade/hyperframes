# Scene Transitions

A transition tells the viewer how two scenes relate. A crossfade says "this continues." A push slide says "next point." A flash cut says "wake up." A blur crossfade says "drift with me." Choose transitions that match what the content is doing emotionally, not just technically.

## Energy → Primary Transition

| Energy                                   | Primary                      | Accent for key moments         | Duration  | Easing                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- | ---------------------- |
| **Calm** (wellness, brand story, luxury) | Blur crossfade, focus pull   | Light leak, circle iris        | 0.5-0.8s  | `sine.inOut`, `power1` |
| **Medium** (corporate, SaaS, explainer)  | Push slide, staggered blocks | Squeeze, vertical push         | 0.3-0.5s  | `power2`, `power3`     |
| **High** (promos, sports, music, launch) | Flash cut, zoom through      | Staggered blocks, gravity drop | 0.15-0.3s | `power4`, `expo`       |

Pick ONE primary (60-70% of scene changes) + 1-2 accents. Never use a different transition for every scene.

## Mood → Transition Type

Think about what the transition _communicates_, not just what it looks like.

| Mood                     | Transitions                                                                                                                                                           | Why it works                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Warm / inviting**      | Light leak, blur crossfade, focus pull, film burn, light leak (shader), thermal distortion                                                                            | Soft edges, warm color washes. Nothing sharp or mechanical. The transition feels like sunlight.                         |
| **Cold / clinical**      | Squeeze, zoom out, blinds, shutter, grid dissolve, gravitational lens                                                                                                 | Content transforms mechanically — compressed, shrunk, sliced, gridded. Zoom out creates clinical distance. No softness. |
| **Editorial / magazine** | Push slide, vertical push, diagonal split, shutter, whip pan                                                                                                          | Like turning a page or slicing a layout. Clean directional movement. Whip pan is a fast editorial camera move.          |
| **Tech / futuristic**    | Grid dissolve, staggered blocks, blinds, chromatic aberration, glitch (shader), chromatic split (shader)                                                              | Grid dissolve is the core "data" transition. Shader glitch adds posterization + scan lines.                             |
| **Tense / edgy**         | Glitch, VHS, chromatic aberration, flash cut, ripple, ridged burn, glitch (shader)                                                                                    | Instability, distortion, digital breakdown. Ridged burn adds sharp lightning-crack edges.                               |
| **Playful / fun**        | Elastic push, 3D flip, circle iris, morph circle, clock wipe, ripple waves, swirl vortex                                                                              | Overshoot, bounce, rotation, expansion. Swirl vortex adds organic spiral distortion.                                    |
| **Dramatic / cinematic** | Zoom through, zoom out, gravity drop, overexposure, diagonal split, color dip to black, cinematic zoom (shader), gravitational lens, domain warp, flash through white | Scale, weight, light extremes. Shader transitions add per-pixel depth.                                                  |
| **Premium / luxury**     | Focus pull, blur crossfade, color dip to black, slow crossfade, cross-warp morph, thermal distortion                                                                  | Restraint. Cross-warp morph flows both scenes into each other organically.                                              |
| **Retro / analog**       | Film burn, light leak, VHS, clock wipe                                                                                                                                | Organic imperfection. Warm color bleeds, scan line displacement. Clock wipe evokes broadcast TV.                        |

## Narrative Position

| Position                   | Use                                                                        | Why                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opening**                | Your most distinctive transition. Match the mood. 0.4-0.6s                 | Sets the visual language for the entire piece.        |
| **Between related points** | Your primary transition. Consistent. 0.3s                                  | Don't distract — the content is continuing.           |
| **Topic change**           | Something different from your primary. Staggered blocks, shutter, squeeze. | Signals "new section" — the viewer's brain resets.    |
| **Climax / hero reveal**   | Your boldest accent. Fastest or most dramatic.                             | This is the payoff — spend your best transition here. |
| **Wind-down**              | Return to gentle. Blur crossfade, crossfade. 0.5-0.7s                      | Let the viewer exhale after the climax.               |
| **Outro**                  | Slowest, simplest. Crossfade, color dip to black. 0.6-1.0s                 | Closure. Don't introduce new energy at the end.       |

## Blur Intensity by Energy

| Energy     | Blur    | Duration | Hold at peak |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ------------ |
| **Calm**   | 20-30px | 0.8-1.2s | 0.3-0.5s     |
| **Medium** | 8-15px  | 0.4-0.6s | 0.1-0.2s     |
| **High**   | 3-6px   | 0.2-0.3s | 0s           |

## Presets

| Preset     | Duration | Easing            |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| `snappy`   | 0.2s     | `power4.inOut`    |
| `smooth`   | 0.4s     | `power2.inOut`    |
| `gentle`   | 0.6s     | `sine.inOut`      |
| `dramatic` | 0.5s     | `power3.in` → out |
| `instant`  | 0.15s    | `expo.inOut`      |
| `luxe`     | 0.7s     | `power1.inOut`    |

## Transitions That Don't Work in CSS

Avoid: star iris, tilt-shift, lens flare, hinge/door. See catalog.md for why.

## CSS vs Shader: When to Use Which

Most compositions should use **CSS/GSAP transitions** (the other categories above). They're simpler, lighter, and handle most needs. Use **shader transitions** only when you need an effect that CSS can't achieve:

| Use CSS/GSAP when                              | Use Shader when                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity, transform, clip-path, filter effects  | Per-pixel noise dissolves, domain warping       |
| Simple crossfades, wipes, slides               | Both scenes actively morph into each other      |
| No images/video in scenes (text + shapes only) | Live video needs to play through the transition |
| Quick to set up, no boilerplate                | Willing to add WebGL setup layer (~200 lines)   |

Shader transitions require setup boilerplate (canvas, scene capture, WebGL init). Read [transitions/shader-setup.md](transitions/shader-setup.md) for the complete code. The fragment shaders themselves are in the Shader section of [transitions/catalog.md](transitions/catalog.md).

## Visual Pattern Warning

Avoid transitions that create visible repeating geometric patterns — grids of tiles, hexagonal cells, uniform dot arrays, evenly-spaced blob circles. These look cheap and artificial regardless of the math behind them. Organic noise (FBM, domain warping) is good because it's irregular. Geometric repetition is bad because the eye instantly sees the grid.
